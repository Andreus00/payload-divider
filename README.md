# payload-divider
a simple python program that divides a file into different files of custom size. I wrote this because i needed to upload a 2k file in the flash memory of an ATTiny 85 which has only 512B SRAM

You will need python 3.7 or greater

Usage: python payloadDivider.py -f fileName -m maxSizeOfEachFile
